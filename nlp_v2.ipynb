In  order  to  know  the  co-occurring  words  with  the  wordBrexit,  we  split  the  list  of tweets  present  in  each  document  into  a  list  of  sentences  and fed them to ”NLTK part of speech parser” When it comes to verbs,  we  are  only  interested  in  the  closest  one  to  the  word \"Brexit\".  Consequently,  we  compare  the  indexes  of  verbs  to the  index  of  the  target  word  (Brexit)  in  every  sentence  that contains  more  than  one  verb  and  chose  the  closest  one.  A similar process was applied to adjectives and adverbs too.\n",
